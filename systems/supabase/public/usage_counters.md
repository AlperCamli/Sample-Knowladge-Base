# `supabase.public.usage_counters`

## Grain

One row **per user per calendar month** (unique on `(user_id, period_month)`).
A CHECK enforces `period_month = date_trunc('month', period_month)` — it is
always the first day of the month. All four counters are CHECK-constrained
`>= 0`. Rows are upserted and incremented atomically via the
`public.increment_usage_counters` SECURITY DEFINER function, which clamps to
non-negative.

## Column meanings & enum decodings

No enums. The counters are running monthly totals of billable activity:

- `tailored_cv_generations_count` — AI tailored-draft generations (relates to
  `supabase.public.ai_runs` of the tailoring flows).
- `exports_count` — completed export jobs (relates to
  `supabase.public.exports`).
- `ai_actions_count` — AI block actions (relates to
  `supabase.public.ai_suggestions`/`ai_runs`).
- `storage_bytes_used` — a **point-in-time** snapshot of stored bytes "as of
  this period" (see `supabase.public.files`), not a monthly delta like the
  other three.

## Join guidance

- Owner: `usage_counters.user_id` → `supabase.public.users.id`. No other FKs.
- These are pre-aggregated summaries; the underlying events live in `ai_runs`,
  `exports`, and `files`. Prefer these counters for entitlement checks and the
  source tables for exact audits.

## Reporting notes

- To compare consumption against plan limits, join `user_id` to the user's
  active `supabase.public.subscriptions` row and its `plan_code`.
- Filter by `period_month` for a given month; a missing row means zero
  recorded activity that month (rows are created on first increment).

## Warnings

- `storage_bytes_used` is a snapshot, **not additive** across months — do not
  sum it over `period_month`.
- The counters are maintained by application increments, so they can drift from
  a live recount of `ai_runs`/`exports`/`files`; treat them as entitlement
  bookkeeping, not a certified event count.
