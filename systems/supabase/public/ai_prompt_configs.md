# `supabase.public.ai_prompt_configs`

## Grain

One row per registered prompt variant. A **partial unique** index enforces at
most one **active** prompt per `(profile, flow_type, coalesce(action_type,''),
provider)` (`where is_active = true`) — that tuple is the runtime resolution
key. No `user_id`: this is shared configuration, not user data.

## Column meanings & enum decodings

- `flow_type` — DB-constrained (`ai_prompt_configs_flow_type_check`) to these
  **13** values: **`job_analysis`, `follow_up_questions`, `tailored_draft`,
  `block_suggest`, `skills_pool`, `block_compare`, `multi_option`,
  `import_improve`, `professional_summary`, `summary`, `improve`, `cv_parse`,
  `cover_letter_generation`**. Same set as
  `supabase.public.ai_runs.flow_type` — the two constraints are maintained
  together in one migration each time the set changes. See Warnings — this doc
  previously listed 11.
- `action_type` (nullable) — for block-level flows, DB-constrained to
  **`rewrite`, `summarize`, `improve`, `ats_optimize`, `options`, `expand`,
  `shorten`**. `null` when the flow is not block-scoped.
- `provider` — default `gemini`; the sentinel **`any`** matches any provider
  as a fallback during resolution.

## Join guidance

No FKs. It is joined only implicitly: `supabase.public.ai_runs` records the
`flow_type`/`provider`/`model_name` actually used, but does **not** carry a FK
to the resolved `ai_prompt_configs` row — there is no stored link between a run
and the prompt version it used.

## Reporting notes

- To audit which prompts are live, filter `is_active = true` and group by
  `(profile, flow_type, action_type, provider)`.
- `prompt_version`/`prompt_key` are the human-facing content identifiers for
  change tracking.

## Warnings

- **`flow_type` was documented as an 11-value set; the DB admits 13.** The two
  missing values are `professional_summary`, added by the phase-11 migration on
  **2026-06-03**, and `skills_pool`, added by phase 14 on **2026-08-01**. The
  11-value list was correct when written (it matched the 2026-04-29 constraint)
  and went stale in two steps after it. A prompt-coverage audit built on the old
  list will report full coverage while both new flows are missing prompt rows.
- **No run→prompt linkage** — you cannot join a specific `ai_run` to the exact
  prompt row it resolved; only the flow/provider/model are recorded on the run.
- `system_prompt`/`user_prompt_template` are free text; no structure to decode.
