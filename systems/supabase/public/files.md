# `supabase.public.files`

## Grain

One row per stored binary object (upload or generated artifact). A partial
unique index enforces one live object per storage location: unique on
`(storage_bucket, storage_path)` where `is_deleted = false`. `size_bytes` is
CHECK-constrained `>= 0`. This is the metadata row — the bytes live in Supabase
storage, not in this table.

## Column meanings & enum decodings

- `file_type` — DB-constrained (`files_file_type_check`) to **`source_upload`,
  `parsed_artifact`, `export_pdf`, `export_docx`, `avatar`, `other`**. It
  encodes the file's role: `source_upload` feeds `imports`; `export_pdf`/
  `export_docx` are produced by `exports`/`cover_letter_exports`.
- `checksum` (nullable) — optional; used to detect duplicate/corrupted uploads.
- `storage_bucket` + `storage_path` — the address inside Supabase storage.

## Join guidance

- Owner: `files.user_id` → `supabase.public.users.id`.
- Inbound (each nullable on their side): `supabase.public.imports.source_file_id`,
  `supabase.public.exports.file_id`, and
  `supabase.public.cover_letter_exports.file_id` all → `files.id`. There are no
  outbound FKs.

## Reporting notes

- Per-user storage = `sum(size_bytes)` where `is_deleted = false` grouped by
  `user_id`; this backs the `storage_bytes_used` figure summarized in
  `supabase.public.usage_counters`.
- Slice artifact production by `file_type` (`export_pdf` vs `export_docx` etc.).

## Warnings

- Soft-deleted rows (`is_deleted = true`) still carry `size_bytes` — exclude
  them from live-storage totals.
- `original_filename` may contain PII — treat as sensitive.
