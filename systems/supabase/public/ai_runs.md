# `supabase.public.ai_runs`

## Grain

One row per AI model invocation. Optional `master_cv_id`/`tailored_cv_id`/
`job_id` record the context (any combination may be null for context-free
flows). A consistency CHECK ties termination to timing: `completed_at` is set
**iff** `status` is `completed` or `failed`.

## Column meanings & enum decodings

- `flow_type` — DB-constrained to the 11-value set shared with
  `supabase.public.ai_prompt_configs.flow_type` (`job_analysis` …
  `cover_letter_generation`).
- `status` — DB-constrained to **`pending` | `completed` | `failed`**.
- `progress_stage` — DB-constrained to **`queued`, `building_prompt`,
  `calling_model`, `parsing_output`, `validating_output`, `persisting_result`,
  `completed`, `failed`** (default `queued`); a finer view of a `pending` run.
- `total_tokens` — the token count to use for cost estimation (per customer
  doc); `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` are the split and may be null on older
  rows.
- `input_payload` (non-null), `output_payload`, `debug_payload` (`jsonb`) —
  **open maps** (`Record<string, unknown>` in code) whose shape **varies by
  `flow_type`**: each flow builds its own payload, so there is no single
  schema. `output_payload` is null until the run completes. Documented shape:
  per-flow JSON object; the concrete per-flow keys are app-defined and **not
  grounded** as a fixed structure here.

## Join guidance

- Owner/context: `user_id` → `users.id`; `master_cv_id` → `master_cvs.id`;
  `tailored_cv_id` → `tailored_cvs.id`; `job_id` → `jobs.id` (all
  `supabase.public.*`).
- Output: `supabase.public.ai_suggestions.ai_run_id` → `ai_runs.id` links a
  run to the suggestions it produced.

## Reporting notes

- AI cost/usage reports sum `total_tokens` grouped by `user_id`/`flow_type`;
  join `provider`/`model_name` for per-model breakdowns.
- Success rate = `completed` / all, by `flow_type`; use `progress_stage` to see
  where `pending` runs stall.

## Warnings

- Payload structure is flow-dependent — do not assume shared keys across
  `flow_type`s (gap above).
- `input_tokens`/`output_tokens`/`total_tokens` are nullable — treat null as
  unknown, not zero, in cost sums.
