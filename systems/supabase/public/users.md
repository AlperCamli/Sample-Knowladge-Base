# `supabase.public.users`

## Grain

One row per application user. `id` is the internal identifier that every
owned table joins to via its `user_id` column; `auth_user_id` is the
separate Supabase-auth identity (a `uuid`, unique) and is the seam to the
`auth.users` table, which is **not in this snapshot**. No soft-delete column
exists here — user rows are not hidden the way CVs are.

## Column meanings & enum decodings

- `locale` — UI language, DB-constrained to **`en` | `tr`** (`users_locale_check`).
- `default_cv_language` — a free-form language code used to seed new CVs; it
  is *not* constrained to the `locale` set.
- `onboarding_completed` vs `onboarding_state` — two distinct signals; do not
  conflate. `onboarding_completed` is the legacy boolean paywall flag;
  `onboarding_state` is the newer guided-tour progress record.
- `onboarding_state` (`jsonb`, default `'{}'`) — per the migration comment,
  shape is:
  ```json
  {
    "steps": { "<step_id>": "<ISO completion timestamp>" },
    "skipped_at": "<ISO>",
    "completed_at": "<ISO>"
  }
  ```
  `steps` maps a step id to its completion timestamp; `skipped_at` present
  ⇒ tour permanently dismissed; `completed_at` present ⇒ tour finished. The
  `'{}'` default means every user starts onboarding fresh.

## Join guidance

`users.id` is the fan-out hub: `master_cvs`, `tailored_cvs`, `jobs`,
`subscriptions` (and all other owned tables) carry a non-null `user_id` FK to
it. Join on `users.id = <table>.user_id`. To reach Supabase auth, join
`auth_user_id` to `auth.users.id` outside this estate.

## Reporting notes

- Deduplicate people by `users.id` (internal), not by `auth_user_id`.
- Active-user metrics should come from downstream activity tables, not from
  `onboarding_completed` alone.

## Warnings

- `email` and `full_name` are **PII** — exclude from shared reporting slices
  unless explicitly required.
- `onboarding_state` internal `steps` keys (the step-id vocabulary) are not
  enumerated in the DB — **gap**: step ids are defined in application code,
  not grounded here.
