# `supabase.reporting.v_jobs_by_status`

## Grain

One row per distinct `status` value present in `public.jobs`. A status with no rows does not appear — absence means zero, not null.

## Reporting notes

- The funnel view: order by the business stage sequence rather than by
  `job_count` to read it as a pipeline.
- `distinct_users` against `job_count` gives jobs-per-user in that stage — a
  concentration signal (a large ratio means a few heavy users, not broad usage).
- `first_created`/`last_created` show whether a stage is active or stale: a
  `last_created` far in the past means nothing new has entered it.

## Warnings

- **These are aggregate views over row-level-security-protected tables.** The
  base tables (`public.*`) enforce per-user RLS, so the execution role reads
  **zero rows** from them directly. These views answer anyway because a view
  evaluates RLS as its *owner*, and they are owned by a role that bypasses it.
  That is a deliberate, narrow opening — and it is why every column here is an
  aggregate or a non-identifying dimension. Do not expect to drill from these
  numbers to a person: no view exposes `user_id`, an email, a name, or any free
  text a user wrote.
- **Small counts can still identify.** The estate is ~24 users. A group of size
  1–2 is potentially personal even though no column names anyone; treat such
  cells as sensitive rather than reportable.
- `status` is not constrained by a database CHECK, so new values can appear
  without warning. Do not hard-code the set; read it from this view.
- Counts are of *tracked postings*, not applications submitted. `applied_count`
  in `v_jobs_by_month` is the closer proxy for submissions.
