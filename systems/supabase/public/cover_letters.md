# `supabase.public.cover_letters`

## Grain

One row per cover letter. `job_id` is **unique**, so there is at most one
cover letter per job (the reciprocal of `supabase.public.jobs.cover_letter_id`,
which is also uniquely indexed). Unlike CV content, the body here is plain
`text`, not JSONB.

## Column meanings & enum decodings

- `status` — DB-constrained to **`draft` | `ready` | `archived`**
  (`cover_letters_status_check`), default `draft`. Note this set differs from
  `tailored_cvs.status` (no `exported` state — export progress lives in
  `cover_letter_exports` and `last_exported_at`).
- `content` — full body text, default `''` (empty until authored/generated).
- `last_exported_at` — set when an export completes; `null` means never
  exported.

## Join guidance

- Owner: `cover_letters.user_id` → `supabase.public.users.id`.
- Job: `cover_letters.job_id` → `supabase.public.jobs.id` (non-null, unique).
  The reciprocal `supabase.public.jobs.cover_letter_id` → `cover_letters.id`
  points back; prefer `cover_letters.job_id` as the canonical direction.
- CV: `cover_letters.tailored_cv_id` → `supabase.public.tailored_cvs.id`
  (nullable).
- Exports: `supabase.public.cover_letter_exports.cover_letter_id` →
  `cover_letters.id` records render jobs.

## Reporting notes

- Because `job_id` is unique, `cover_letters` joins 1:1 to `jobs` — safe to
  join without aggregation.
- Use `cover_letter_exports` (not `last_exported_at` alone) for export success
  and format breakdowns.

## Warnings

- No soft-delete column; `archived` status is the closest "hidden" signal.
- `content` may contain PII (candidate/company details) — treat as sensitive
  in shared slices.
