# `supabase.public.subscriptions`

## Grain

One row per subscription record for a user. A user can accumulate several over
time (renewals, plan changes, re-subscribes), but a partial unique index
enforces **at most one *active* subscription per user**
(`subscriptions_one_active_per_user_idx`: unique on `user_id` where
`status in ('active','trialing')`).

## Column meanings & enum decodings

- `status` — lifecycle state. **The DB does not CHECK-constrain this column**,
  so there is no closed enum to publish. Grounded values: **`active`** and
  **`trialing`** are the "active" states (from the partial unique index
  above); the customer model additionally lists **`canceled`** as an example.
  The complete provider-driven vocabulary (e.g. `past_due`, `incomplete`,
  `unpaid`) is **not grounded here** — a named gap; do not assume a fixed set.
  Note there is no `inactive` value in any grounded source, and `trialing` is
  a distinct third state — this column does not reduce to an active/inactive
  binary.
- `plan_code` — internal product plan identifier. Stated value set:
  **`free`** and **`pro`**. This set is **customer-stated, not observed and
  not DB-enforced** — there is no CHECK constraint on the column, and the
  table held **0 rows** when queried on 2026-08-07, so no value has ever been
  seen in data. Authoritative for intent; verify against rows before pinning
  a certified metric to it.
- `provider` — free text; the customer model gives Stripe as the example. Not
  DB-enumerated.
- `provider_customer_id` / `provider_subscription_id` — the provider-side ids;
  both nullable and indexed *per provider* (`(provider, provider_*_id)` where
  not null), so uniqueness is scoped within a provider.
- `current_period_start` / `current_period_end` — nullable; absent for records
  with no established billing period yet.

## Join guidance

- Owner: `subscriptions.user_id` → `supabase.public.users.id`. There are no
  inbound FKs (nothing references `subscriptions`).
- To reconcile against the billing provider, match on
  `(provider, provider_subscription_id)`.

## Reporting notes

- "Currently paying / trialing users" = rows with `status in ('active',
  'trialing')` (one per user by the unique index). Do not `count(*)` all
  rows per user — historical rows inflate it.
- Churn signals: `cancel_at_period_end = true` flags a scheduled cancel that
  has not yet ended; a terminal `status` is a separate, already-ended state.
- Plan mix is `group by plan_code`, but see the empty-table warning below
  before publishing any such number.

## Warnings

- `status` is **not** a DB enum — treat any set as open and provider-defined
  (gap above). Certified revenue/subscription metrics must pin the exact
  status values they count and cite the provider's own status vocabulary.
- `plan_code` is **not** a DB enum either — no CHECK constraint exists. The
  `free`/`pro` set is customer-stated (see `sources`), not enforced and not
  observed. A new plan code can enter the data with no schema change and no
  change to this doc's schema hash, so nothing will flag this doc stale when
  it happens. Do not treat it as closed in a certified metric.
- The table was **empty (0 rows) as of 2026-08-07**. Any plan-mix or
  subscription-count report built on it returns nothing today, which makes a
  zero result indistinguishable from a broken query. Confirm the table is
  non-empty before interpreting a zero.
- No `is_deleted`/soft-delete here; lifecycle is expressed through `status`.
