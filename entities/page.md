# page

## What it is

A public web page of CVBuilder on `jobspecificcv.com` — the marketing/landing
pages, `/pricing`, and `/career-advice/:categorySlug/:articleSlug`. Both search
(GSC) and analytics (GA4) address pages by URL. **No Supabase table represents
these pages**: their content and routes are frontend-defined (`routes.tsx`,
`career-advice-content.json`). `cv_templates.slug` is a design-template id, not
a page URL.

## System map (routing table)

- `gsc.standard.page` — **search-identity.** Answers "how did this URL perform
  in Google Search" (clicks, impressions, position, query). Its value is the
  **canonical URI** Google selected — a full URL including scheme + host.
- `ga4.standard.pagePath` — **analytics-identity.** Answers "on-site behavior
  for this page" (views, engagement, events). Its value is the **path only**
  (hostname and query string stripped), e.g. `/career-advice/...`. Full-URL
  variants exist: `ga4.standard.pageLocation` (scheme+host+path+query),
  `ga4.standard.fullPageUrl` (host+path+query, no scheme).
- Supabase — **not a source for public pages** (see above).

Routing: search performance → GSC; on-site behavior → GA4; relate the two by URL.

## Keys & join paths

Documented blend key pair — normalize the GSC full URL to a path and match GA4
`pagePath`:

`path(gsc.standard.page) == ga4.standard.pagePath`, where `path()` = strip
scheme + host (`jobspecificcv.com`, including any `www.`/subdomain), drop
`?query` and `#fragment`, then strip a trailing slash **unless that would
leave the path empty — the site root normalizes to `/`, which is what GA4
reports**.

> The root carve-out is not a nicety. Search Console returns the homepage as
> `https://jobspecificcv.com/`; without the exception, `path()` yields the
> empty string while GA4 reports `/`, and the join silently drops the
> busiest page on the site (195 views in the 2026-06-29 → 2026-07-27
> window, over 4× the next page) while returning a tidy-looking result for
> every other URL. Verified 2026-07-29 against live gateway pulls from both
> systems: 21 of 21 Search Console pages match with the carve-out, 20 of 21
> without it.

- The property is single-domain (`sc-domain:jobspecificcv.com`), so host is a
  constant and **path is a safe common key**.
- Alternative: blend GSC `page` ↔ GA4 `pageLocation` or `fullPageUrl` (both
  full URLs) — fewer transforms, but reconcile scheme (`pageLocation` has it,
  `fullPageUrl` does not) and query strings.

## Cross-source resolution rule

Row-level, per-page join **is** supported. Recurring reports → Looker Studio
blend of GSC `page` (normalized to path) with GA4 `pagePath` on the documented
key. Ad-hoc questions → agent fetches both, normalizes, and joins on path.
Prefer the path key — it is the most stable across the two URL shapes.

## Caveats

- **Canonicalization:** GSC `page` is Google's *canonical* URL, which can
  differ from the URL actually visited and recorded by GA4 — normalized paths
  may still not line up 1:1.
- **byPage aggregation:** grouping/filtering GSC by `page` forces `byPage`
  (you cannot aggregate by property), changing impressions/position (gsc
  dimensions).
- **Trailing slash / query / case:** GA4 `pagePath` excludes the query string;
  GSC canonical URLs usually have none — but trailing-slash and case
  differences cause misses, so normalize both sides. In the 2026-07-29
  verification window neither side carried a query, a fragment, an uppercase
  character or a `www.` host, and the only trailing slash was the root's
  (see the rule's carve-out above).
- **Coverage:** GSC sees only pages that appeared in Search; GA4 sees only
  pages where the tag fired (bots excluded client-side). `(not set)` and
  sampling apply.
- **No Supabase leg** — see Ungrounded gaps in the PR body.
