# `supabase.public.ai_suggestions`

## Grain

One row per proposed block edit. A scope CHECK enforces **exactly one** of
`tailored_cv_id`/`master_cv_id` is set per row. An applied-consistency CHECK
ties `status = 'applied'` to `applied_at` being non-null (and the non-applied
states to `applied_at` being null).

## Column meanings & enum decodings

- `action_type` — DB-constrained to **`rewrite`, `summarize`, `improve`,
  `ats_optimize`, `options`, `expand`, `shorten`** (same set as
  `supabase.public.ai_prompt_configs.action_type`).
- `status` — DB-constrained to **`pending` | `applied` | `rejected` |
  `expired`** (default `pending`).
- `option_group_key` (nullable) — when a flow returns several alternatives
  (`action_type = 'options'`/`multi_option`), siblings share this key.
- `before_content` (nullable) and `suggested_content` (non-null) — `jsonb`
  **`CvBlock`** snapshots (see `supabase.public.master_cvs` for the shape):
  `suggested_content` is built from a replacement `CvBlock` in code;
  `before_content` is the prior block, null when there was none. Stored as open
  maps (`Record<string, unknown>`), so `CvBlock` is the expected — not
  DB-enforced — structure.

## Join guidance

- Provenance: `ai_suggestions.ai_run_id` → `supabase.public.ai_runs.id`.
- Owner: `user_id` → `supabase.public.users.id`.
- Target (exactly one): `tailored_cv_id` → `supabase.public.tailored_cvs.id`
  or `master_cv_id` → `supabase.public.master_cvs.id`.
- Applied result: `supabase.public.cv_block_revisions.ai_suggestion_id` →
  `ai_suggestions.id` records revisions an accepted suggestion created.

## Reporting notes

- Acceptance rate = `applied` / all, by `action_type`.
- Filter on the set scope column before joining to the matching CV table to
  avoid null joins.

## Warnings

- `before_content`/`suggested_content` `type`/`fields` vocabularies are
  app-defined, **not DB-grounded** (same gap as CV content).
- `expired` suggestions were never acted on — exclude them from
  accept/reject-rate denominators if you want a decision rate.
