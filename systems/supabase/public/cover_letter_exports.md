# `supabase.public.cover_letter_exports`

## Grain

One row per cover-letter export attempt (a job may be re-exported, producing
several rows over time). Ordered for reporting by `(status, created_at desc)`
and per cover letter by `(cover_letter_id, created_at desc)`.

## Column meanings & enum decodings

- `format` — DB-constrained to **`pdf` | `docx`** (`cover_letter_exports_format_check`).
- `status` — DB-constrained to **`processing` | `completed` | `failed`**
  (`cover_letter_exports_status_check`). A lifecycle CHECK ties `status` to the
  populated/empty state of `file_id`, `completed_at`, and `error_message`:
  a `completed` row has `file_id` and `completed_at` set; a `failed` row
  carries `error_message`; a `processing` row has none of the terminal fields.

## Join guidance

- Owner: `cover_letter_exports.user_id` → `supabase.public.users.id`.
- Source: `cover_letter_exports.cover_letter_id` →
  `supabase.public.cover_letters.id`.
- Artifact: `cover_letter_exports.file_id` → `supabase.public.files.id`
  (nullable until `completed`).

## Reporting notes

- Export success rate = `completed` / all attempts, grouped by `format`.
- This mirrors `supabase.public.exports` (which handles CV exports); keep the
  two apart — cover-letter exports never carry a `template_id` or CV scope.

## Warnings

- A single cover letter can have many export rows; deduplicate by
  `cover_letter_id` (e.g. latest `completed`) before counting "exported cover
  letters".
- `file_id` is `null` for non-completed rows — an inner join to `files`
  silently drops in-flight/failed exports.
